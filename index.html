      Someone smiles at you on the subway. How do you respond? </h1>

      Hint: in some Western countries, smiles are often exchanged between strangers. </h2>

They are being friendly. I smile back.

Assume they are flirting with me and start conversation.

  <span id="answer_question_1"> Though smiling differs across cultures, in America, people are very pro-smiling, as it shows a sign of general happiness. However in many European countries, people can come across as friendly but will not be caught smiling at you to display it. In high-context countries like Japan or Russia, any overt displays of happiness towards strangers is actually shunned.

      At an international conference, an American employee motions the "okay" sign to foreign colleagues. Is this problematic? </h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle has-text-align-left">

      Note: in the USA, people often use this gesture to agree. </h2>
    <button id="fourth" class="button is-small">
No, everyone knows this as a universal sign.
</button>
    <button id="fifth" class="button is-small">
Yes, as it's rude gesture for some cultures over others.
</button>
    <button id="sixth" class="button is-small">
Neither, everyone at the conference would understand its meaning. </button>

<section class="section has-text-centered">
  <span id="answer_text_2"></span>
  <span id="answer_question_2"> In Brazil, Germany, Russia, and many other countries around the world, the “okay” sign is an offensive gesture because it is used to depict a private bodily orifice. The sign actually does mean “okay” in the United States, however in places like Japan it means “money,” and it's commonly used to signify “zero” in France. While this gesture isn't offensive everywhere you go,  make sure you're aware of what it means before you go.

      You go for a meal at a French restaurant and the steak is a little under-seasoned for your liking. You wave over the waiter and ask for salt. He returns a little while later looking a little disgrunted. What went wrong?

    <h2 class="subtitle has-text-align-left">
      Remember: the French take their food very seriously.

<section class="section has-text-centered">
  <span id="answer_text_3"></span>
  <span id="answer_question_3"> In  France, Italy and Spain, asking for condiments to alter your meal might raise a few eyebrows. It's considered rude to the chef if the customer wants to alter an ordered meal. Also, if there are condiments on the table, feel free to use them – if not, refrain from asking!

      You are going on a small tour of Southeast Asia. At your first stop, you ask locals for directions and maintain eye contact with them to make sure both parties understand each other. Everyone quickly averts their gaze. What's happening? </h1>

    <h2 class="subtitle has-text-align-left">
      Note: some countries consider making direct eye contact as insulting.
    </h2>
    <button id="tenth" class="button is-small">
They aren't making eye contact because they're shy.

    <button id="eleventh" class="button is-small">
They are trying to avoid helping you by not looking at you.

    <button id="twelfth" class="button is-small">
It's disrespectful for them to make direct eye contact with you.

<section class="section has-text-centered">
  <span id="answer_text_4"></span>
  <span id="answer_question_4"> Many Asian cultures consider making direct eye contact as a sign of agression or disrespect. On the other hand, in many of these same cultures, avoiding eye contact with a member of the opposite sex is seen as a sign of respect. Outside Asia, direct eye contact can be seen as flirtatious or inappropriate.

      You are at an international peace gathering with people from around the world. An Englander is showing the ‘V‘ for victory sign. Could this be taken the wrong way?
    </h1>

    <button id="thirteenth" class="button is-small">
Yes, It’s such an obscene and offensive gesture. </button>

    <button id="fourteenth" class="button is-small"> Maybe, especially since the gesture can mean differently for different people. </button>

    <button id="fifteenth" class="button is-small"> No, he is simply promoting peace. </button>

<section class="section has-text-centered">
  <span id="answer_text_5"></span>
  <span id="answer_question_5"> While the ‘V’ hand symbol is denoted as a sign of victory in England, abroad it means differently. Making this gesture with your palm facing inward in Australia, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and several other countries throughout the world, funnily enough, means 'up yours.'
