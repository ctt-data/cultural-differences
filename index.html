      In Brazil, Germany, Russia, and many other countries around the world, the “okay” sign is a very offensive gesture because it is used to depict a private bodily orifice. The sign actually does mean “okay” in the United States, however in places like Japan
      it means “money,” and it is commonly used to signify “zero” in France. Clearly the “okay” sign isn’t offensive everywhere, but, it doesn’t mean the same thing to every country or culture in the world. So make sure, wherever you go, that you are
      aware of what the sign can actually mean, so that you aren’t offending anyone in your understanding of a symbol of agreement. -- </h3>
