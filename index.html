  <span id="answer_question_1"> In Brazil, Germany, Russia, and many other countries around the world, the “okay” sign is a very offensive gesture because it is used to depict a private bodily orifice. The sign actually does mean “okay” in the United States, however in places like Japan
      it means “money,” and it is commonly used to signify “zero” in France. This gesture isn't offensive wherever you go, so make sure you're aware of what the sign means depending where you are in the world.</span>

      At an international conference, an American employee motions the "okay" sign to foreign colleagues. Is this problematic? </h1>

      Note: in the USA, people often use this gesture to agree. </h2>
    <button id="fourth" class="button is-small">
No, everyone knows this as a universal sign.

    <button id="fifth" class="button is-small">
Yes, as it's rude gesture for some cultures over others.
</button>
    <button id="sixth" class="button is-small">
Neither, everyone at the conference would understand its meaning. </button>
